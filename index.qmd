Hi, I’m Macey Dvorak, an emerging environmental professional specializing in climate adaptation, carbon management, and ecosystem sustainability. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University through the Professional Science Master’s program, with anticipated graduation in December 2026, and I hold a B.S. in the same field with a minor in Diversity and Inclusion in Natural Resources. My work spans ecological research, climate justice communication, sustainability-focused curriculum development, and community-based initiatives, using geospatial and statistical tools such as R, ArcGIS, QGIS, and Excel. Across research, education, and project coordination roles, I focus on research-informed decision-making, inclusive education, and science communication that supports both communities and ecosystems.
