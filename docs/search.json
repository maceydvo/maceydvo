    "text": "Motivations\n\n\n\nI’m motivated by the opportunity to use research and data to support environmental sustainability and community engagement. My work spans ecological connectivity studies, climate-focused social science research, and conservation analyses, where I apply tools like R, ArcGIS, QGIS, Graphab, and Excel to study environmental challenges and identify actionable solutions.\nEqually important is translating research into practical, community-driven impact. As a leader in the Leave No Trash University Challenge, I organized participation across multiple universities and communicated environmental data in accessible ways to inspire sustainable behaviors.\nUltimately, I am driven by connecting research with action, whether analyzing ecological systems or supporting initiatives like Leave No Trash, so that science leads to tangible environmental benefits and resilient communities.\n\n Leave No Trash Student Group - Leading a global university-based initiative to properly dispose of waste to create cleaner communities.\n Poster presentation at CURC (Celebrating Undergraduate Research and Creativity).\n\n\n\nBeyond My Work\n\n\n\nOutside of research and environmental projects, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with friends through hiking, camping, and skiing in areas near and far.\nUltimately, my interests beyond my work and education fuel my passion for sustainability. They remind me that impactful environmental work is not just about data, but also about the relationships, experiences, and communities that surround it.\n\n Hiking The Narrows in Zion National Park\n Skiing (or more so falling) somewhere in Canada\n Hammocking over a stream during a camping trip"

    "text": "Hi, I’m Macey Dvorak, an emerging environmental professional specializing in climate adaptation, carbon management, and ecosystem sustainability. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University through the Professional Science Master’s program, with anticipated graduation in December 2026, and I hold a B.S. in the same field with a minor in Diversity and Inclusion in Natural Resources. My work spans ecological research, climate justice communication, sustainability-focused curriculum development, and community-based initiatives, using geospatial and statistical tools such as R, ArcGIS, QGIS, and Excel. Across research, education, and project coordination roles, I focus on research-informed decision-making, inclusive education, and science communication that supports both communities and ecosystems."
