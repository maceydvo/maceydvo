<h2>Motivations</h2>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
I’m motivated by the opportunity to use research and data to support environmental sustainability and community engagement. My work spans ecological connectivity studies, climate-focused social science research, and conservation analyses, where I apply tools like R, ArcGIS, QGIS, Graphab, and Excel to study environmental challenges and identify actionable solutions.

Equally important is translating research into practical, community-driven impact. As a leader in the Leave No Trash University Challenge, I organized participation across multiple universities and communicated environmental data in accessible ways to inspire sustainable behaviors.

Ultimately, I am driven by connecting research with action, whether analyzing ecological systems or supporting initiatives like Leave No Trash, so that science leads to tangible environmental benefits and resilient communities.

<h2>Beyond My Work</h2>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Outside of research and environmental projects, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with friends through hiking, camping, and skiing in areas near and far.

Ultimately, my interests beyond my work and education fuel my passion for sustainability. They remind me that impactful environmental work is not just about data, but also about the relationships, experiences, and communities that surround it.
